# Retail-Sales-Prediction-ML-regression-
Capstone project for Almabetter Retail Sales Prediction (ML regression)


This project aims to predict the daily sales of 1,115 Rossmann stores across Europe for up to six weeks in advance using machine learning regression models. The model takes into consideration various factors that influence store sales, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality, and locality.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical sales data for Rossmann stores, including 1,115 stores in 7 European countries. The dataset can be obtained from My drive link to dataset -

Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the code in this project:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
The code was developed and tested using Python 3.7.9 on a Windows 10 machine.

Methodology

The project follows the following steps:

Data exploration: Analysing the dataset and getting insights about the data.
Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and feature engineering.
Feature engineering: Creating new features that could impact the target variable.
Model selection: Testing different machine learning regression models.
Model training and evaluation: Training the selected model and evaluating its performance using cross-validation.
Hyperparameter tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters.
Final model: Training the final model on the entire dataset.
Prediction: Using the final model to make sales predictions for the test set.

Conclusion

The developed machine learning regression model can predict daily sales for up to six weeks in advance for Rossmann stores with a high level of accuracy. The model can help Rossmann store managers make informed decisions regarding inventory management, staffing, and promotional strategies, ultimately leading to increased sales and profitability for the business.
