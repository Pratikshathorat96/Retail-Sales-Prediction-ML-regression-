# Retail-Sales-Prediction-ML-regression-
Capstone project for Almabetter Retail Sales Prediction (ML regression)

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the sales of a retail store based on various factors such as the store location, item type, time of year, and promotional events.

The model can be used by retail businesses to forecast sales, plan inventory, and optimize pricing strategies.

Data
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data.

It contains historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores across Germany, spanning from January 2013 to July 2015.

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to remove missing values and outliers, and features have been transformed as necessary.

Methodology
The project involves several steps, including:

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and relationships between the features
Feature engineering to create new features and transform existing ones as necessary
Model selection and training using regression algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests
Model evaluation using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)
Results
The best performing model was a random forest regression model, which achieved an RMSE of 1004.23 on the test set.

The feature importance analysis showed that the most important features for predicting sales were the store type, the day of the week, and the promotional events.

Usage
To use this model, simply input the relevant features such as store location, item type, time of year, and promotional events, and the model will output a predicted sales value.

The model can be integrated into a retail store's inventory management and pricing systems to improve sales forecasting and optimize business operations.

Conclusion
The retail sales prediction model developed in this project provides an accurate and reliable way for retail businesses to forecast sales and optimize their operations. With further refinement and optimization, this model can be applied to other retail industries and businesses.
